The code on the Arduino is not the code present within this folder. Efforts to improve the Stepper Motor Control needs to be considered.

During simulation the Stepper Motor freezes in operation after x- simulations. This is due to a problem with the Raspberry Pi interfacing with the Arduino.

Due to the scope of our design requirements there was not enough time to include this fix into the scope. But it is an inconvenience that should be solved in the future. 

To try to solve this problem please look at the request and receive data mehtods within the .ino file.
